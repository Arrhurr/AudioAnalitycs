# Recommandation

Dataset
We use the Universal Top Spotify Songs dataset from Kaggle, containing audio features and metadata for popular tracks across multiple countries.

Preprocessing
The dataset is cleaned by removing duplicates and missing values. Audio features are then standardized using z-score normalization to ensure fair distance computation.

venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=music-env
